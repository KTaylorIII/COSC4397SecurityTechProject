Ideas to solve video stabilization:

Use different stabilization algorithms before detection and compare results

Find a stationary object in the image and use it as a reference point

Find the transformation between frames and smooth is to be close to zero?

Calculate translational and angular displacement of points of interest in relation to reference points of interest. Adjust the image accordingly.
