#Ideas to solve video stabilization:

Use different stabilization algorithms before detection and compare results

Find a stationary object in the image and use it as a reference point

Find the transformation between frames and smooth is to be close to zero?

Calculate translational and angular displacement of points of interest in relation to reference points of interest. Adjust the image accordingly.

Identify inclement weather conditions and minimize false positive events (Fogging, lensing, glare)

Minimize transmission latency and bandwidth requirements for remote locations via efficient compression 

Define maximum angular and translational displacement before maintenance is required

Issue maintenance alerts to responsible crews after periodic/ event-related times

Establish secure, lightweight communications links with central "dashboard" server and related surveillance systems

Provide a comprehensive API through which external programs may communicate to extend access to camera data

Provide an intuitive user interface through which important events and image information are relayed.

Provide archive functionality through which events of interest are recorded for future review by security officers and their supervisors
